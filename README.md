# Twitter 

## What is Twitter?
This app was created when I was learning CSS in term 1, and I want try the twitter offical website layout to sharpen my css skills. However, I was not able to add database and image storage feature because I only know CSS that time. So, I picked up this project and re-design some elements and added more features on to it to make it a complete web app.

Some difficulities during the project is the trending section, which the section will show the tweets with most tags. I might include more feature like comment and retweet in the future.
